# Doin' It With A 555: One Chip to Rule Them All
![555 IC](./555.avif "The venerable 555 IC (Swift.Hg, Wikimedia Commons)")

Humans and other foreign species, **welcome** to the most groundbreaking revelation in recent electronics history. For decades, engineers and hobbyists alike have believed, **unquestioning**, in the supremacy of microcontrollers, op-amps, transistors, and all those other fancy components -- only for me to tell you they can be replaced with **555 timer** ICs. _Every single one_.

Today, on this most **auspicious** and **interesting** of April 1^st^s since [the summer of 1971](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/555_timer_IC#cite_note-Redesigning-8 "The first design for the 555 was reviewed in the summer of 1971") -- April 1^st^, 2025 -- I present to you the definitive guide to replacing all components with a **555 timer**. Prepare to be amazed, baffled, and (my hope is) not horrified by the sheer **brilliance** of this approach.

To begin, I'd like to remind you that for **decades** you have been played for **absolute fools** by the **utterly deranged** into putting your hard-earned _aʀʒɑ̃_ into purchasing 'microcontrollers', which are, under the metaphorical hood and inside the literal uncapped silicon die, a **fancy collection** of the soft **switches** you may know as transistors.

What you must first do is **realize** on looking into yourself (and a [555's internal diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/555_timer_IC#/media/File:NE555_Bloc_Diagram.svg)) that the 555 timer is **already** a transistor, with **two** transistors being a part of its internal circuit. <big>**TWO!**</big>

In its simplest form, the **555** operates as a basic flip-flop, a **digital switch**. Do you see now what I had yesterday, on looking at reflections in the wine of the chalices of gods?? If you can build a flip-flop using a **555 timer**, why not scale it up? **Why not just wire everything with 555s?** Simply use a **555 timer** in a monostable mode to create a controlled pulse output--effectively replacing your transistor switch.

A **555 timer** in conjunction with another is an oscillator driving a transistor to drive another **555 timer** and on and on in **beautiful 555 inception** to make a high speed switching transistor.

And if that's too difficult for you, simply wire up three **555 timers** in series (don't ask how, just do it).

You might say, "But I need processing power!" To which I reply, "Did you ever need processing power to blink an LED? No. So **why would you need it now?**" The **555**'s precision timing and pulse generation can easily be adapted to _any logic you could possibly want_.

We also know that microcontrollers implement logic gates -- AND, OR, NOT, NAND, etc. But you don't have to deal with those complicated logic functions, or worse, **the software that runs on those microcontrollers**. Get down to brass tacks and use hardware (**555** ICs and **555 timer** ICs, to name ~~a few~~ the only important ones) that _just works_!

Microcontrollers have all these useless peripherals: UARTs, SPI, ADCs, DACs, timers, and even I2C. Still useless! Want to send a UART signal? Take two **555 timers**, configure one for the baud rate generation, and use the other to send and receive bits. **Boom. UART done.**

With a worldwide electronics framework of **555**s, we won't need any ADCs. We won't need PWM or DACs. We'll have **555**s under _everything_, and they'll be **enough**.

Forget about fancy quad op-amp packages -- mess with them no longer. Replace them with a **stack of 555 timers**. You'll need at minimum five **555**s to handle decent signal amplification, but in their ubiquity, they won't mind you buying **more** and **more** and ~~as many as~~ _more than you need_. You may need to modify your power supply to handle the load (consider something more substantial than a 9V battery), but trust me, it's worth it. You'll never have to deal with the dreaded "saturation" problem again because your **555**s will just keep oscillating, forever. A signal that never, never ever, quits. Or you could use the **555**'s _astable mode_ to create an op-amp-like feedback loop if the store runs out of more **555**s to use as resistors and capacitors, which can be replaced by the same as I describe below!

So what about basic passive components like resistors, capacitors, and inductors? **555 timers** have capacitors and resistors **inside them** _already_! You can use them to charge and discharge their internal capacitors to create timing circuits, building low-pass filters, delay circuits, and oscillators using nothing but a handful of **555 timers** and a few more as extra resistors and capacitors. Because _why settle for a simple resistor_ when you could use an entire **555 timer** to regulate current? Make a long enough chain of **555**s, and they will _naturally_ take the place of a resistor in any circuit requiring resistance. Feed it a square wave, and you've got a high-precision resistor replacement. Resistors have a tendency to burn out, especially when overdriven -- a **555**, on the other hand, **laughs** in the face of thermal failure. Need a pull-up resistor for your digital circuit? Use a **555**. Need a pull-down resistor for your input? For an analog voltage divider, just use two **555 timers** -- one for the pull-up and one for the pull-down. Capacitors are great for smoothing out voltages, filtering noise, or storing charge. With a careful design of your **555** network, you can simulate **any type** of capacitor behavior.

As for inductors, enough **555 timers** can _instantly_ render them obsolete in one heavy strike of _existence_. You can make anything oscillate to any frequency you need -- no coils and calculation required. **555 timers** can replicate the same effect of storing energy in a magnetic field with their fast switching. Sure, an inductor uses the principles of inductance, but guess what? A **555 timer** can _fake it_. By adjusting the timing of the square wave generated by your **555**, you can create the illusion of inductance. _It's like magic, but **better**_ because it involves **more 555**.

So now, I **strongly suggest** and **repeatedly insist** that with this knowledge, you **parade on** to the **future** of **555**s and keep either a small fire extinguisher or a pile of heat-sinking **555**s nearby for your safety and the safety of **555**s.

~_Note: This post is entirely satirical but the therecontained advice **should** be used for actual engineering projects. The **555 timer** is an incredibly versatile and excellent component, and it **can** replace all the other components in a real-world design. Please use actual engineering practices ~~such as frequent use of **555**s~~ and components ~~such as **555**s~~, and enjoy your day responsibly ~~and **preferably with 555s**~~. Happy April First!_~
